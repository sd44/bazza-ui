We are always looking for ways to improve bazza/ui and the components we provide.

## Feedback board

> [!TIP] Use our [feedback board](https://bazzaui.userjot.com) to submit & view feedback.

We are testing out **UserJot** as a mechanism for collecting feedback.

This is the place to submit feature requests, bug reports, and anything else.

Please make sure that you do a quick search to see if someone else has already submitted the same feedback.

- If you find similar feedback, please **upvote it** to show your support.
- If you don't find a similar feedback, please **submit a new one**.

## Contributing

> [!WARNING] We are putting together a contribution guide, so stay tuned!

If you're interested in contributing directly to bazza/ui, please do! We're open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/bazzadev/ui) and welcome contributions from the community.
